# Predictive-sales-model-using-alteryx
This project uses alteryx software to perform data preparation and modelling and forecasting of income and sales.
Price elasticity is defined as the percentage change in consumption in response to 1% change in price. Price elasticity is usually negative indicating that when price goes up, consumption goes down and vice versa.
Income elasticity is defined as the percentage change in consumption in response to 1% change in income. Income elasticity is usually positive indicating that when income goes up, consumption also increases. The model is consistent with the economic theory because when the income was lower sales was lower  but when the income increased the  demand increased. The greater the value of income elasticity, the more sensitive is demand to income change.
